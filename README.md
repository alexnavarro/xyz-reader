# XYZ Reader
> XYZ Reader is an Android application for read articles.

This project was created for the Android Developer Nanodegree program by Udacity. The task was to update the look and feel of an app to meet Material Design specifications based on some design specifications.

The main libs used are:
* [picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) for leading with loading images
* [okhttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) as http/https client
* [volley](https://github.com/google/volley) for leading with http
* [Android support libraries](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/setup.html) for leading with Material and design

##Learn
* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.

## Install
I recommend you use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) because the development is easier thant command line.

For generate the apk using command line use this command: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
